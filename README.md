Device Description

Our project is an IoT automated desktop fish bowl, which we call Fish Delight. Despite the name, it does much more than just dispense a fish bowl. AutoClean also features a proximity and motion sensor that can accurately measure the motion of the user to realize hand motion control, making it an ideal entertainment for employees working in an office all the day. When the motion of the human hand is detected, the smart fish bowl will interact with different actions - either turning on the water fountain or displaying various LED modes.
